Steps to use pypy:

1. Downloading and installing pypy:
    i. PyPy is distributed as a precompiled binary that can be downloaded from http://pypy.org/download.html
        (Note: check the version compatibility)

    ii. You can initialize a new virtual environment, where we can install additional packages using the following command:
        path-to-pypy>pypy -m ensurepip
        path-to-pypy>pypy -m pip install virtualenv
        path-to-pypy/Scripts>virtualenv my-pypy-env

    iii. Activating and deactivating virtualenv:
        path-to-Scripts>activate
        path-to-Scripts>deactivate

    iv. Also install numpy and matplotlib in my-pypy-env using:
        pip install numpy matplotlib
    
2. Using pypy:
    i. activate pypy env
    ii. path-to-simulator-file
    iii. python -m timeit --setup "from simulator_v2 import benchmark" "benchmark()"
    iv. To compare with Python, deactivate pypy and run same command:
        python -m timeit --setup "from simulator_v2 import benchmark" "benchmark()"
